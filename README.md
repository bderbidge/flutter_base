# flutter_base

This is a starting point for all my new flutter projects. Things that are included in this project include:

1. Firebase implementation for cloud firestore, firebase auth, and firebase analytics.
2. State is implemented using States_Rebuilder.
3. Various utils that I find useful for different projects.
4. Base Pages, widgets, and mixins to be used to help standardize pages across the app.

TODO: Do a more in-depth write up of the above points
